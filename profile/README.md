## The bioAI research group

Our goal is to build brain-inspired artificial intelligence (AI) methods to make advances in theory-development of brain function and AI technology focusing on energy efficiency, explainability, robustness, causal representation learning, and continual learning.

The Biologically-inspired Artificial Intelligence (bioAI) research group is hosted by [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no/about) in collaboration with the [University of Oslo (UiO)](https://www.uio.no/english/about/). We are also strongly connected to UiO's [Centre for Integrative Neuroplasticity (CINPLA)](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/research/sections/fyscell/cinpla/about/).

You can find out more about us on [our lab website](https://bioai-oslo.github.io/).
